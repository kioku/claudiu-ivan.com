Alright, maybe it's less about land and more about launching. Welcome aboard this freshly deployed blog!

After putting it off for ages, I have finally decided to start writing. I'll be documenting my experiences in software developmentâ€”sharing insights, challenges, and the occasional eureka moment.

As a developer, I consider knowledge sharing invaluable. This blog aims to be a resource for myself, and fellow developers, offering a blend of technical insights and personal reflections.

Allow me to offer some context. My journey began in the early 2000s when I first encountered web programming. The WAMP stack was one of the go-to solutions of the time, sparking my interest in software as a career. This eventually led me to pursue a computer engineering degree.

I will primarily focus on web development and related technologies. You can expect posts about frontend frameworks, backend architectures, and everything in between. Otherwise, I'll explore whatever topics I find interesting in the future.

This website is intentionally kept simple, free from unnecessary digital clutter. Built with Zola and SimpleCSS, it emphasizes content over complexity. I might add some subtle enhancements in the future, but for now, it's all about the substance.
