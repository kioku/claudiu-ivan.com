Aperture represents a systematic approach to API interaction designed specifically for AI agents and automated systems. The tool addresses the fundamental challenges of secure, repeatable API calls in an increasingly agent-driven world.

## The Problem: API Chaos in Agent Systems

Modern AI agents need to interact with dozens of APIs, each with different authentication patterns, rate limits, and data formats. The traditional approach of hardcoding API interactions leads to brittle, unmaintainable systems.

## The Solution: Declarative API Specifications

Aperture introduces a declarative approach where API interactions are specified in structured configuration files, enabling:

- **Consistent Security Models**: Standardized authentication and authorization patterns
- **Automatic Rate Limiting**: Built-in respect for API constraints
- **Type-Safe Interactions**: Schema validation for requests and responses
- **Agent-First Design**: Optimized for programmatic consumption
